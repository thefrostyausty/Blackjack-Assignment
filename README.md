## Questions to Answer:

### What assumptions/choices you made to overcome any lack of clarity you found in the instructions?

*I am a person that likes to ask for help, in all things that involve coding. So I reached out to internet searching and fellow coders with small details like what I should remember is needed for the game to function properly.*

### What you did well on this project

*I think I did well with pseudocoding my thoughts and how things worked out. I also think my code is readable and easy to understand*


### Rationale on design choices, algorithmic decisions made
 
*I kept everything simple and algorithmically I think it could be a little cleaner however I still struggle with that concept*

### Tradeoffs you encountered while programming and how you resolved them

*Again, I like to ask around rather than suffer in silence so that helped me best and even my books I've purchased about programming helped me as well.*

### What you would improve on this project given more time

*Adding more dialogue between the game and the player's choices and final results*

### What manual tests you ran on the code

*If by manual tests, meaning running through the game, I've played it about 3 times*

### How to run any automated tests you created (if they exist)

*No automated tests ran*
